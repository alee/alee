### Oyo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [computer scientist and research software engineer](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6523-6079) working to (hopefully) improve our abilities to understand and adapt to our rapidly changing world.

Since I began my career at ASU in 2006 I've been a proponent of open, transparent computational science. Current and past projects include:

- [the Network for Computational Modeling in the Social and Ecological Sciences (CoMSES Net)](https://comses.net)
- [the Open Modeling Foundation (OMF)](https://openmodelingfoundation.org)
- [Synthesizing Knowledge of Past Environments (SKOPE)](https://www.openskope.org) 
- [the Consortium of Scientific Software Registries and Repositories (scicodes)](https://scicodes.net)
- [the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR)](https://www.tdar.org)
- [the Research Data Alliance's FAIR For Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg)
- [the FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group](https://force11.org/groups/software-citation-implementation-working-group/)

Other work includes leading the development of multiplayer "serious games" used to study [collective action and the commons](https://iasc-commons.org/) ðŸ¤² via the ["Virtual Commons"](https://github.com/virtualcommons/) GitHub organization.


### Service

I serve as a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) certified instructor and lesson maintainer for the [Python Gapminder lesson](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder) and also volunteer as a [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) facilitator.

In my remaining spare time I also do my best to serve on the [BMI Council](https://github.com/csdms/bmi) (2022-), the [DataCite Services and Technology Steering Group](https://datacite.org/steering.html) (2023-), and the [Open Modeling Foundation's](https://openmodelingfoundation.org) [Cyberinfrastructure Working Group](https://www.openmodelingfoundation.org/governance/working-groups/#cyberinfrastructure-working-group) (2022-).

### Other Irrelevant Details

Music up and support your local community symphony! Here's ours, [the Tempe Symphony Orchestra](https://www.tempecenterforthearts.com/events/resident-artists/tempe-symphony-orchestra) - we offer free concerts 4 times / year.  I also enjoy supporting [girls hockey](https://www.arizonakachinas.com/).
