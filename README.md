### Oyo 👋

I'm a [computer scientist and research software engineer](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6523-6079) working to (hopefully) improve our abilities to understand and adapt to our rapidly changing world with [ethically grounded](https://issues.org/topic/ethics/), adaptive, and responsible computational science.

I began my career at [ASU](https://scas.asu.edu) in 2006 and have long been a proponent of open, transparent computational science in service of Sustainability, ethical collective action and Peace. Current and past projects include:

- [research into collective action and the commons](https://iasc-commons.org/) 🤲 via [multiplayer "serious games" and experiments, the Virtual Commons](https://github.com/virtualcommons/)
- [the Network for Computational Modeling in the Social and Ecological Sciences (CoMSES Net)](https://www.comses.net)
- [the Open Modeling Foundation's Cyberinfrastructure Working Group](https://www.openmodelingfoundation.org)
- [Synthesizing Knowledge of Past Environments (SKOPE)](https://www.openskope.org) 
- [the Consortium of Scientific Software Registries and Repositories (scicodes)](https://scicodes.net)
- [the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR)](https://www.tdar.org)
- [Research Data Alliance's FAIR For Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg)
- [FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group](https://force11.org/groups/software-citation-implementation-working-group/)
- [the Social Ecological Systems Library](https://seslibrary.asu.edu)


### Service

- [The Software/Data/Library Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) instructor and lesson maintainer for the [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder) and [Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://github.com/carpentries-lab/good-enough-practices) lessons
- [Community Surface Dynamics Modeling Systems' Basic Model Interface (BMI) Council](https://github.com/csdms/bmi) (2022-)
- [DataCite Services and Technology Steering Group](https://datacite.org/steering.html) (2023-)
- [Open Modeling Foundation's](https://openmodelingfoundation.org) [Cyberinfrastructure Working Group co-chair](https://www.openmodelingfoundation.org/governance/working-groups/#cyberinfrastructure-working-group) (2022-)
- [Consortium of Scientific Software Registries and Repositories](https://scicodes.net) co-chair (2023-2025)

### Other Irrelevant Details

Music up with a local symphony! Here's some of ours:

- [The Tempe Symphony Orchestra](https://www.tempecenterforthearts.com/events/resident-artists/tempe-symphony-orchestra), plays four free concerts / year at the lovely [Tempe Center for the Arts](https://www.tempecenterforthearts.com/)
- The newly formed [Scottsdale Symphonic Orchestra](https://scottsdalesymphonicorchestra.org/) holds regular concerts at the [Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts](https://scottsdaleperformingarts.org/)

Consider listening to Sibelius, Barber, Beach and the usual suspects (Beethoven, Borodin, Brahms, Dvorak, Elgar, Mendelssohn, Mahler, Mozart, Ravel, Saint-Saëns, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaminoff, and the list goes on and on and on)...
